# Dice-Roller

This app was one of the first personal projects that I created after Re:Connect. While tackling something difficult as building a social media app was fun, I thought it was nice to have a moment to pull back and work on something simple instead.

Then this app was born! It's a macOS menu bar app that allow the user to click and return a random number, similar to rolling a dice. __This can come in handy when you don't have a pair of dice around so you can play your planned Monopoly game with friends or whatever without having to reschedule!__

## Archival Notes
Some functionalities were planned to be implemented such as the option for two dices but over time I lost interests in developing these old apps so therefore, they were never implemented.
